# Changelog

## [3.3.0] - 2026-05-04

### Changed
- **Multi-currency CSVs without `default_currency` now error.** Previously the
  parser silently picked the most frequent currency and dropped the rest,
  masking real account activity (a PayPal account can hold balances in
  several currencies). Single-currency CSVs are unchanged. To export every
  currency from a mixed file, define one config section per currency and
  run the converter once per section — see README *"Multi-currency &
  foreign-currency purchases"* for the migration recipe.
- When `default_currency` is set explicitly, it now acts as an explicit
  filter. If the chosen currency is not present in the file, the parser
  warns (rather than silently producing an empty OFX with no signal).

### Fixed
- Mixed-currency files no longer fail core's `Statement.assert_valid()`
  cross-currency sum. Foreign-currency rows (e.g. an isolated USD charge,
  or the foreign-currency anchor of a 4-row conversion group) are filtered
  out of `stmt.lines` before the sum runs; the foreign amount remains
  preserved on the statement-currency merchant-debit leg via
  `<ORIGCURRENCY>`.

### Developer tooling
- Test suite now invokes `Statement.assert_valid()` after every parse via
  a `_parse_and_validate` helper, pinning the cross-currency invariant at
  unit-test time rather than at runtime.
- `pyproject.toml` now configures `pytest-cov` (term-missing report,
  `--no-cov-on-fail`) so coverage shows on every test run.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- Empty CSV files no longer crash with `max() over empty sequence` — the
  parser now raises `ParseError(0, ...)` with a clear message.
- `_normalize_amount` strips NBSP (U+00A0) before decimal conversion, so
  German-locale exports with `-1\xa0234,56` parse correctly.
- European thousands separator (`-1.090,00`) parses correctly; previously
  `.replace(',', '.')` collapsed to `-1.090.00`. Rewritten as a locale-
  aware heuristic based on the last `,` vs last `.` position.
- Start balance now derived from the *chronologically earliest* row.
  Previously exports that arrived newest-first produced a wrong start.

### Added
- **Currency-aware balance math.** Running totals, `start_balance`, and
  the balance-consistency check now filter rows by the statement
  currency. Foreign-currency rows (e.g. a USD charge on an EUR
  statement) no longer corrupt the EUR running total.
- **Foreign-currency conversion pair-collapse.** PayPal records a
  foreign purchase as four rows; the parser now detects this pattern,
  drops the redundant foreign zero-conversion row, and annotates the
  statement-currency merchant-debit leg with `orig_currency` (a
  `Currency(symbol=<foreign>, rate=|local|/|foreign|)`), so OFX
  consumers render `<CURRENCY>EUR</CURRENCY><ORIGCURRENCY>USD</ORIGCURRENCY>`
  per OFX 2.2 §5.2 CURRATE semantics. Validated against real exports:
  19/548 groups collapsed in an EUR sample, 46/184 in a CDF sample.
- **Auto-detection of config settings.** `config.ini` is now optional:
  - `dataformat` inferred from the Date column separator (`.` → DMY dots,
    `-` → ISO, `/` → DMY/MDY disambiguated by any day > 12 in the file).
    USD-majority files break the `/`-ambiguous tie toward MDY.
  - `default_currency` inferred via majority vote over the Currency column.
  - `default_account` defaults to `"PayPal"` if unset.
  Any ini-provided value still overrides auto-detection, and every
  inferred value is logged at `INFO` level.
- **Header validation** with a clear `ParseError(1, ...)` when the column
  count doesn't match PayPal's export shape.
- **Chronological sort** of rows before parsing, so exports that arrive
  newest-first are handled correctly.
- **German locale headers** (`Datum`, `Brutto`, `Netto`, …) accepted
  alongside English headers.
- **Balance consistency sanity check** post-parse: warns if
  `start_balance + Σ amounts` diverges from the last row's `Balance`
  column, which catches silent amount-parsing drift, skipped rows, or
  PayPal column-layout changes.
- 37 unit tests covering header validation, locale-aware amount parsing,
  auto-detection, and chronological sorting.

### Changed
- **Renamed plugin entry point `paypal-convert` → `paypal`.** Users with
  an existing `[section]` in `config.ini` that sets `plugin = paypal-convert`
  must update it to `plugin = paypal`. With no config.ini, the CLI can
  now be invoked as `ofxstatement convert -t paypal input.csv output.ofx`
  since ofxstatement falls back to plugin-name lookup.
- Added a docstring on `PayPalPlugin` so `ofxstatement list-plugins`
  shows a description next to the plugin name.
- Migrated packaging from `setup.py` to PEP 621 `pyproject.toml`; removed
  stale `requirements.txt`.
- Replaced generic `ValueError` with ofxstatement's framework
  `ParseError` for format-mismatch errors.
- Full type annotations across `paypal.py` (parameters, returns, class
  attributes).
- Added module-level `logger` with `INFO` messages tracing auto-detected
  settings and parse summary.

### Developer tooling
- Added `Makefile` with `test`, `mypy`, `black`, `ruff`, `coverage` targets.
- Added GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) with a Python
  3.11 / 3.12 / 3.13 matrix running pytest, mypy, black, and ruff, plus
  an `all-checks` aggregation job for branch protection.
- Added `[tool.mypy]` and `[tool.ruff]` configuration to `pyproject.toml`;
  `pip install -e ".[dev]"` now pulls `pytest`, `mypy`, `black`, `ruff`.

## [3.0.1]

### Fixed
- Docstring formatting in `split_records`.

## [3.0.0]

### Changed
- Fork of `gerasiov/ofxstatement-paypal` under the new name
  `ofxstatement-paypal-2`.
